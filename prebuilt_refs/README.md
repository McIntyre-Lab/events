# Event Analysis - Prebuilt annotations
The data in this directory includes prebuilt annotations for several genomes. At present this includes:

* Human: Aceview hg19
* Human: Ensembl hg38
* Mouse: RefSeq mm10
* Drosophila melanogaster: FlyBase r6.17

These annotations are build assuming a read size of 100 bp. More pre-built annotations will be added over time.

These pre-built annotations can be found at: https://bio.rc.ufl.edu/pub/mcintyre/papers/newman_events_2017/prebuilt_refs
